#### Summary: <br />
1. Find line(s) of symmetry given a set of points on an infinite plane
2. Find reflected point(s) given point(s) and line(s) of symmetry, i.e. "x-axis", "y-axis", "y=-34x-29.4"

Results are outputted in ../symmetry/ or ../reflection/, respectively, with the option to visualize the solution and write out the CSVs containing the resulting point(s) and/or line(s).

#### Files: <br />
- get_symmetry_line.py : Python code
  + holds get_symmetry_line(), where it calculates line(s) of symmetry given list of point(s), for each unique combination of given set of points. There are options to specify coordinate plane, the number of decimals to round for output, visualize results, and output results to a directory.
- get_reflection_point.py : Python code
  + holds get_reflection_point(), where it calculates point(s) reflected given line(s) of symmetry and given point(s), for each unique combination of given points and lines. There are options to specify coordinate plane, the number of decimals to round for output, visualize results, and output results to a directory.
- computation.py : Python code
  + holds all the methods required to compute get_symmetry_line() and get_reflection_point()
- Line.py : Python code
  + Line class is used to represent a line in a 2D plane given an equation in slope-intercept form, x=x1, or y=y1, i.e. y=3x-231.4, x=2, y=-34421.6
- output_options.py : Python code
  + holds the methods that customize ways to output the solution, including visualizing using matplotlib library and writing out to CSV
- main.py: Python code
  + a sample script that runs get_symmetry_line() and get_reflection_point() given sample inputs.
